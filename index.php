                            <td>Apple Watch is good, but better suited on the
                                wrists of early adopters and boutique shop
                                regulars. It's convenient but there's a learning
                                curve you have to overcome and a high price that
                                some people won't be able to get around.</td>
                            <td>The Gear Live has a clean metal body, more features for the price than the LG watch,
                                works with many Android phones (4.3 or later), has impressive Google Voice recognition,
                                and could have an interesting variety of apps sooner than later. Terrible battery life;
                                a display that doesn't work in bright sunlight; a strange card-based notification system
                                that doesn't always pop up with the info you want; annoying snap-on charger that's not easy to attach.</td>
                            <td>The Sony SmartWatch 3 might not be the best-looking Android Wear device so far –
                                that honour belongs to the LG G Watch R – but it’s by far the most useful. Its
                                design may be pretty uninspiring and the display is fairly mediocre but the
                                functionality afforded by the GPS is unrivalled in the Google smartwatch arena
                                and the battery life is far better than we’ve seen on any of the Sony’s rivals.</td>
